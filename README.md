## Usage

Include `jquery.equalheights.min.js` after calling jQuery in the footer. You can also include in your `plugins.js` file if using [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com).

Alternatively, install with [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower):

	bower install jquery.equalheights

### Auto Initialize

There are two options for auto initialization:

1. Add `data-equal="MYELEMENTS"` to the parent container, where MYELEMENTS is div, section, li, whatever you'd like.

2. Alternatively, add class of `equalheight` to elements and that need their heights equalized and don't adding the `data-equal` element to the parent.

### Manually Initialize

	$('.yourelements').equalHeights();

Select whatever elements need equal height.

### Responsive

If you use auto initialzation, the plugin is responsive and will re-call itself whenever the window is resized, ensuring the elements remain the same size during browser changes.

If you use manual initialization, you'll have to call the function manually when the window is resized:

	$(window).resize(function() {
		$('.yourelements').equalHeights();
	});

### Caveats

If using @font-face or Google Web Fonts, you may need to wrap the function call in a `setTimeout` for 100ms-200ms (`jQuery.height()` needs to fire after the font is rendered to properly calculate the height).

You can also call `equalHeights` on `$(window).load()`, although [there are some issues on when that event gets fired between various browsers](http://api.jquery.com/load-event/).

## Requirements/Browsers
